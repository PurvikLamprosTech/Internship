// This code is a JavaScript implementation of the word game "Shiritori". The class Shiritori has a constructor that creates an empty array this.words and sets this.game_over to false.

// The play method takes in a string s as an argument. If this.words is empty, s is pushed into this.words and the words array is returned. If this.words is not empty, the code checks if s is already in this.words using a for loop. If s is found in this.words, the value of this.game_over is set to true and the string "game over" is returned.

// If s is not found in this.words, the code gets the last word from the this.words array and assigns it to the variable word. The code then checks if the last letter of word is equal to the first letter of s. If the condition is true, s is pushed into this.words and the words array is returned.

// If the condition is false, this.game_over is set to true and the string "game over" is returned.

// The restart method resets the this.words array to an empty array and sets this.game_over to false. The string "game restarted" is returned.




// Let's say you have a Shiritori object and you've already played some words, for example:

// const game = new Shiritori();
// game.play("apple");
// game.play("ear");
// game.play("rhino");

// Now, the words array within the Shiritori object looks like this: ["apple", "ear", "rhino"].

// So when you execute this line of code: let lastword = this.words[this.words.length - 1];

// The variable word will hold the value "rhino", which is the last word in the words array.
